### Try it here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ankush29/CheckGPT

CheckGPT is an AI-powered text analysis tool that predicts if the text is generated by AI like ChatGPT. It evaluates perplexity and burstiness scores of the GPT model, providing valuable insights for investigating the origin of text content. üí°

This project is a fun hobby and WIP project, aimed at creating an open-source version of webapps like GPTZero Pro, a popular closed-source website. I think open-sourced AI text detection tools can be useful to ensure academic integrity in schools, where it's essential to verify that students are independently crafting their essays and answers for their personal growth, the transparency offered by open-source software enhances the trust and credibility of the evaluation process.

It uses GPT-2 model with an additional linear layer at the end to get the probability distribution of generating the current token sequence, which are used to estimate the perplexity and burstiness scores to classify the document.

## Features üöÄ

- ‚úÖ Evaluate the perplexity and burstiness scores of text generated by AI.
- ‚úÖ Predict the label for text content: 'AI', 'Human + AI', 'Human'.
- ‚úÖ Predicts the percentage of text content written by AI
- ‚úÖ Supports PDF and Word documents for text analysis.
- ‚úÖ Download the analysis results as a CSV file for further exploration.

## Getting Started üèÅ

To start using CheckGPT, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit the hosted app on Hugging Face Spaces: <a href='https://huggingface.co/spaces/ankush29/CheckGPT' target='_blank'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue'></a>
2. Upload your PDF or Word documents.
3. Click the "Start Checking" button to analyze the text content.
4. Explore the results, including the predicted AI percentage, perplexity score, burstiness, and predicted output.
5. Download the analysis results as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Faster Performance ‚ö°Ô∏è

Hugging Face hosted app is slow! If you want to experience much faster performance, deploy CheckGPT on your local device using the following steps:

1. Clone this CheckGPT repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/Ank-Cha/CheckGPT.git` and navigate to the project directory using the command: `cd CheckGPT`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the CheckGPT app using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

### Optimization for MacBook Apple Silicon and CUDA supported Devices

For MacBook Apple Silicon devices, optimize the performance even further by changing the device from `"cpu"` to `"mps"` in app.py.

For other cuda supported devices, you can try changing the device to `"cuda"` for enhanced performance.

in app.py
```python
# device = "mps"  # For MacBook Apple Silicon
# device = "cuda"  # For other cuda supported devices
```
